# Assignment 6

"""
Create a function called last2 that accepts a string argument.
The function should return the count of the number of times that the last
2 characters appear in the rest of the string. You should not count
the last 2 characters as an occurrence. The last 2 characters is just the
sequence your function should look for in the remaining string.

So "hixxxhi" yields 1 (we won't count the end substring).


last2('hixxhi') → 1
last2('xaxxaxaxx') → 1
last2('axxxaaxx') → 2
